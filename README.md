# Development Pattern üìù

### Application Architecture

This application leverages the [Server and Client Composition Patterns](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/composition-patterns) recommended by Next.js to prioritize server-side rendering while minimizing client-side usage for optimal performance and maintainability. The main architectural strategies include:

- **Server and Client Composition**:  
  The application is designed with a "server-first" approach, where most components and pages are rendered on the server. Client-side rendering is only used for specific sections that require it (e.g., hooks, effects, or interactivity).

  - Large pages or components are composed of smaller, server-rendered parts. When client-side functionality is required, only the specific section is moved to the client, avoiding unnecessary client-side rendering for the entire page. This keeps the application efficient and aligns with Next.js best practices.

- **File-Based Routing**:  
  The application follows the [Routing Files pattern](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/project-structure#routing-files), organizing related pages into groups and implementing dedicated files for key states:

  - **`loading.tsx`**: Displays a loading state while data or the page is being fetched or generated.
  - **`notfound.tsx`**: Handles 404 errors gracefully for pages not found.
  - **`error.tsx`**: Manages unexpected errors within specific routes.

- **Data Sharing Between Components**:  
  Im not a big fan on `useContext` or other client-side state management tools in server-first applications even Next [dont recommend it](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/composition-patterns#sharing-data-between-components), the application takes advantage of [fetch](https://nextjs.org/docs/14/app/api-reference/functions/fetch) and caching. Data fetched for a page is shared seamlessly across components without duplicating requests cause in next14 cache is stored by default. This approach avoids the need to move components to the client unnecessarily using.
  By reusing cached data, the application improves performance and reduces the overhead of additional client-side state management useContext, useReducer, useState, useEffect.

- **Server Actions**:

The application employs server actions for handling HTTP requests and others server-side logic. These actions encapsulate business logic and are invoked:
Directly in server-side components making it asynchronous and in event handlers in client-side components, enabling  integration of server-side functionality with client-side interactivity when necessary.

- **Static Generation**:

Blog pages are created in the build time and are rendered on the server.

---

This architecture ensures that the application remains fast, scalable, and maintainable, fully embracing the modern capabilities of Next.js to optimize rendering strategies and data management. This is just related to Next but specific to React there are small HOC components, use of Hooks Pattern and Container/Presentational Pattern, lazy loading and portals.
